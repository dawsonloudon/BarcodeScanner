BarcodeScanner (iOS/Android/WP8)
==============

Combination of [iOS/Android Scanner plugin](https://github.com/wildabeast/BarcodeScanner) and [WP8 Scanner plugin] (https://github.com/bloxlab/BarcodeScannerWP8)

Because both plugins are formatted the same and use the same JS namespace, they cannot both be add to the same project. By combining the two into one plugin, you can make use of this functionality for all three platforms in one project.

NOTE: The WP8 plugin only supports the `SCAN` functionality at this time.
